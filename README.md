# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This repository contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C programming language. The game uses if-else statements, functions, and arrays to implement the logic of the game.

# How to Play
To play the game, simply run the executable file generated after compiling the code. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to get three X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal. Players take turns marking the grid with their symbol until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

# Compilation
To compile the code, use a C compiler such as GCC. For example, to compile the code using GCC on Linux, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
    gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe
    ./tictactoe.exe
```

# Usage
To start the game, run the executable file generated after compilation. Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game.
